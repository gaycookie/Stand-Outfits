<!-- 
  In order to make sure that urls work proper you have to replace spaces with "%20" 
  So for exmaple a female outfit url wouuld look like: "Online%20Female/[R]%20Unknown%20-%20Pink%20Sexy%20Cop.txt".

  Images should be urls too and can be uploaded to the correct folder inside Images.
  And make sure the name is the same as the outfit so its easier to find it if needed.

  If the outfit has no tags or image, you can just fill in "-".
